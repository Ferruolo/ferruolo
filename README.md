## About Andrew Ferruolo

I am a recent University of Michigan Engineering graduate. Recently, I have helped to build the core infastructure for Brainwave Analytics, Vector Insights, and pMeets.co. Since graduating, I have worked as a founding engineer at Gattaca Tech.

I love building stuff, as you can see here. Here are my favorite projects on here:

1. Stainless - Still in progress, Stainless is a rust-based ML framework. Eventutualy, it aims to provide optimized computation for a wide range of parallelizable operations
2. Certainty DB - This is a DB which aims to translate natural language into a database query, allowing users to effectively query data without knowing sql. It also allows for querying and sorting "qualitative" data, for example, I can query "best restraunts for a date in East Village, Manhattan" and get real data, not just 100 poorly compiled lists or dead links and false positives.
  
4. Chaos Monkey AI - This was a take home for a company, basically, it uses agentic structure to move throughout an app and test it

I am currently looking for a job, so if you like what you see, please give me a shout at andrew.ferruolo@gmail.com
