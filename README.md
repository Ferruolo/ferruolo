## About Andrew Ferruolo

I am a recent University of Michigan Engineering graduate. I love building stuff, 
as you can see here. Here are my favorite projects on here:

1. Stainless - Still in progress, Stainless is a rust-based ML framework. Eventutualy, it aims to provide optimized computation for a wide range of parallelizable operations
2. My Vector DB - I don't have a name for it yet. This is a vector DB based on the BTree structure, using vector dot products as indexes, rather than numbers or letters. Once I finish implementing it and wrapping it in a tokio web server, it should be interesting to see what I can do with it
3. Chaos Monkey AI - This was a take home for a company, basically, it uses agentic structure to move throughout an app and test it

I am currently looking for a job, so if you like what you see, please give me a shout at andrew.ferruolo@gmail.com
